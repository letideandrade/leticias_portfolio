					<span class="title">Priscila's Bakery - Branding Design Project</span>
					This project was very special to me. A childhood friend of mine, who is highly talented in the baking/pastry field, decided to open her own business. She needed a brand to represent her business and visual identity for her new venture, well as a website to showcase her work and a modile App for customers to browse products and place orders. I was brainstorming for the brand, slogan and logo ideas until she chose this one logo that I had initially sketched by hand on a piece of paper. Then, I recreated the chosen logo using Adobe Illustrator to create a vector graphic, so she could use it for printing purposes in her physical store, on uniforms, and in pamphlets.

				Concerning this project, it all started when a creative mom moved to another country and had the opportunity to explore a huge diversity of products of all kinds that she had never seen or used before, products like cosmetics, clothing, toys, even foods. So, she opened a business to sell imported products, shipping lots of products to her homecountry that could only be found abroad. During the project, the ideation process was developed to create a trademark, designing 50 options of logos. The client chose 8 logos she believed matched the idea of her business best, in order to choose one in the near future.

					<span class="title">Board Game Project - Part I: Ideation and Design</span>
					
					The purpose of this project was to develop a game that encourages socialization and learning among children aged 10 to 12. This board game serves as a supplementary educational tool for English classes, designed to engage both children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and neurotypical children. The goal is to promote inclusive socialization and learning in schools. The game's visual interface was created to be accessible to all students, and the prototype was tested in classes at Yazigi School (an ESL school in Brazil), where both autistic and neurotypical students learn together. The game enhances traditional educational materials by making lessons more enjoyable and interactive. The project aims to benefit both children with special needs and regular children by fostering engagement, promoting socialization, and enhancing knowledge.

					The second part of this project involved developing the board game prototype for testing and obtaining feedback from players to address possible errors and improve playability before finalizing the project. The prototype was printed on canvas, and the cards were made of 300 gsm paper. The game was tested with four groups of students at Yazigi School. Feedback indicated that all students, including those with special needs (as this project aims to include), were able to play easily, without doubts concerning the game's mechanics. The visual interface was designed to be easily understood by both autistic and neurotypical children, promoting interaction and learning between them. The feedback also confirmed that the game was accessible and effective in fostering interaction and learning, serving as a useful and enjoyable tool to promote knowledge in schools.
